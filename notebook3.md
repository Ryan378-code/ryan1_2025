<h1>My Purpose: </h1>
<p>Skittles wasn't my first choice. I initially struggled to choose a topic, but then settled on a topic that wasn't academic and would be more casual: my favorite candy. Skittles have been a staple of my childhood, especially on Halloween. I also thought this blog page would be a great opportunity to not only explore programming (and all the programming languages that come with it, such as Javascript, Python, etc), but also talk about something I normally don't get the opportunity to. I simply wanted to have fun with this project, providing very brief information on my topic but still offering some elements of "me" by adding a personal review element.</p1>
