<h1>Plan:</h1>
    <p>In this project, Sprint 1, I planned to create a blog page that demonstrated my interest in Skittles (my selected topic), but also in programming. Since I tend to focus on customization, I decided to make this project focus more on functionality (without making things look terrible). This includes getting the information across without stacking paragraphs directly on top of each other, creating games, and creating a "Nighthawk" page that contains my notebooks and leads to other bits of information (EX: About me, or about Skittles). I am not abandoning customization altogether, but rather focusing on the practical elements of the blog page.</p>

<h1>Accomplishments:</h1>
    <p>I surprisingly managed to check off a lot of the boxes when it comes to the things I wanted to accomplish. I do wish my page looked more organized and colorful, however. I managed to pick up quite a lot about Javascript, one of my weaker languages, in working on this project. Thankfully, I had plenty of support from my peers and friends with coding experience (Thank you to Paaras!). I am more comfortable working with some newer elements, such as Jupyter Notebooks. I did run into some errors (which I discuss below). I managed to get in some images, but unfortunately not as many as I would've liked. Some of the images also just look weird or out-of-place. I also feel that bits of my code are redundant or even unneccesary, even more so when I was starting out. For instance, I would customize individual elements in my "script" section instead of just using <style.></p>

<h1>Problems and Solutions:</h1>
<p>I've run into too many problems to count. Here I discuss only the major ones. Towards the beginnning of the course, I noted that my computer was unable to access Slack. When I tried to access Slack, it would bar me from accessing it, citing that my browser was not correct (but giving me operating systems for some reason). I managed to get my hands on a new laptop (how convenient), and began to set up VSCode and the setup process began. With regards to actual coding, I ran into an issue with my page deploying via Github, since my "build" wasn't working. I reached out on Slack, and Mr. Mortensen suggested that it had something to do with my code corresponding to Mario. I made the changes, but it didn't work. I took matters into my own hands and figured out that I could simply force a merge after getting my Python interpreter correct (reference the one in my virtual environent, not usr/bin.) Thankfully, this worked. After 3 hours. Another issue I ran into was my pages breaking or being inaccessible, typically my .md files. I discovered that when linking my files, I had to switch the .md to .html, since my browser doesn't actually read the files directly in Markdown.</p>
