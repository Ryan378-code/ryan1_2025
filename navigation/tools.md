        <h1>Initially Setting Up (Welcome to AP CSP!)</h1>
        <p>The beginning of this course was rough. I initially started this course on a MACOS, but when I attempted to access Slack, I would be redirected towards a page that told me to download a valid operating system. I sought help from my peers and Mr. Brown, and apparently I needed to download an alternate version of Chrome in order to get it to work. I tried it at home, but it didn't work. I managed to get my hands on another laptop, which was immediately compatible. From there, I followed the steps to ensure I had all the necessary bundles, programming languages, extensions in VSCODE, and other files such as Ruby. I did some version checks to ensure things were working, and thankfully they were. I did run into several problems throughout my setup, such as random errors, my "make" command not working, and the list goes on.</p>
        <div id="code">
            <h1>Code, Code, Code!</h1>
            <p>The following week or so was also relatively difficult. I didn't have as much experience in coding and JavaScript as I would've liked, and I ended up spending my weekends learning JavaScript, CSS, and HTML on W3Schools, YouTube, and even my peers. HTML is much easier, but that accounts for why it's a language mainly for "setting things up." JavaScript is trickier, and I'm still learning. I had to ask for help several times about my syntax, only to figure out the issue was me forgetting a bracket or a quote. Regardless, the amount of issues, failed codes, and just random errors is innumerable. Creating the submenu, for instance, wasn't difficult. However, linking buttons to another page was a challenge. Apparently, most browsers don't read Markdown files directly, which is why I had to switch my files over to a name such as ".html" instead of ".md." Adding SASS/CSS elements to my code wasn't difficult either, but I often had to stop and pause to figure out how I was going to center an image or adjust its properties. It often took hours to figure things out, but I believe it was worth it in the end.</p>
