        <h1>Flavor and Taste:</h1>
        <div id="family">
            <p>Sour Skittles have a distinctive tart and tangy coating, which gives them a sour kick before the sweet fruit flavor of the candy comes through. The sourness is typically more intense than in other sour candies.</p>
        </div>
        <h1>Typical Flavors:</h1>
        <div id="passions">
            <p>The flavor assortment in Sour Skittles usually includes a mix of fruity flavors. Common flavors are: lime, lemon, orange, grape, or even berry. If you're lucky, berry can also be called sour wild berry.</p>

        <h1>How are Sour Skittles Different:</h1>
        <div id="things">
            <p>Like the original Skittles, Sour Skittles have a hard candy shell with a chewy center. However, the shell is coated with a sour, sugary powder. This adds some intrigue to the flavor profile of the candy and is also what provides that tart flavor.</p>
