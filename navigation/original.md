            <p>Skittles Gummies come in various flavors, often inspired by the classic Skittles candy lineup. This typically includes flavors like Strawberry, Orange, Lemon, Green Apple, and Grape, though specific flavor assortments can vary by region and packaging.</p>

        <h1>Texture:</h1>
        <div id="passions">
            <p>Unlike traditional Skittles, which are hard and coated with a sugary shell, Skittles Gummies have a soft, chewy consistency. Theyâ€™re made with gelatin, which gives them their gummy texture.</p>
        </div>
        <h1>Varieties:</h1>
        <div id="things">
            <p>This form of Skittles also comes in other flavors, such as Wild Berry and Sour. While these aren't new flavors, this variety allows you to enjoy your favorite flavors with a more chewy texture.</p>
