        <h1>Original:</h1>
        <div id="family">
            <p>The original Skittles are my absolute favorite. While I do enjoy the other variations, such as the gummies, I don't think they are as good as the original. However, I might be biased, since I do associate this version of the candy with my childhood. (9/10)</p>

        <h1>Gummies:</h1>
        <div id="passions">
            <p>The gummy version of Skittles is a close-contender for my favorite. I am usually a huge fan of chewy candies or gummies, such as Haribo Gummy Bears. These are a great pick if I want something lighter or something with more chewing. (8/10)</p>
        </div>
        <h1>Sour:</h1>
        <div id="things">
            <p>I'm normally not a fan of sour candies. This version feels sweet, sour, and tangy all at the same time. It's definitely new, but far from my favorite, as much as I would prefer to like this one. (5/10)</p>
